Using //Title
Style.less 
- compiles to style.css
- This should be used as your standard stylesheet

Layout.less
- contains structural styles
- Instead of having <nav id="main-navigation" class="three columns">, you can have <nav id="main-navigation">
- Then, define nav#main-naviation in layout:
		nav#main-navigation{
			.three (@breakpoint);
		}
- .three is the column number, @breakpoint will define the mobile, table and desktop sizes for that column width.

Normalize.less
- Replaced the standard H5BP CSS reset

Core.less
- Contains main styles repeated across projects
- Has classes like .ir, ::selection, base body typography and image max widths

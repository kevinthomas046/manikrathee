Built using environmentally friendly, reusable code. Powered by Jekyll, Github, & Music.

I added this entire code-base to a public repo in the interest of sharing. Working with jekyll was a lot of fun while I was on the campaign, and I could have used a solid reference of another site that did it. So, here it is.

This site has some relatively-well documented code and quite a bit of varying liquid templating variables that make it very flexible.

And all of it was available for you to check out, fork and experiment with. 

If this helps even one person get a better grasp of jekyll, then this will have been a success.

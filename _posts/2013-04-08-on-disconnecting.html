<p>Creators. Makers. Designers. Engineers. Regardless of title, we all have a sense of pride in creating something of quality. We slave over our respective platforms, paper/code/software/web, and we strive to create something that represents us as creatives. Our craft is incredibly important to us, just as it was to craftsmen in the past who spent hours or days sculpting their materials into final products.</p>

<p>But there is a rift in our profession and it is threatening the very craft we respect. That rift is the minimum viable product (MVP) that is currently thriving in startup cultures.</p>


<h4>The MVP</h4>

<p>Let me first say that I believe that the MVP is a critical part of the 'new product life-cycle' and I am, by no means, saying that the MVP itself is the problem.  </p>

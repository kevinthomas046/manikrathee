<p>There is a strike going on right now from the San Francisco Taxi Labor Union. They are unhappy with Ubers, RideShare and Lyfts taking all of their business. But it begs the question - if customers are leaving, are these new innovators to blame?</p>

<p>From my perspective, there is a really simple reason customers are not using regular cabs anymore. Allow me to take my experience and paint you a word picture.</p>

<article class="comparison">
  <section class="question">
    <h4>The Process of Finding a Cab</h4>
    <div class="left">
      <p><strong>Taxi</strong></p>
      <p>Try hailing a cab for anywhere between 5-10 minutes while several empty ones ignore me and drive passed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p><strong>Uber</strong></p>
      <p>Wait 3 minutes for a driver to arrive and call my phone, while I enjoy a beer at home. Follow their location via GPS.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="question">
    <h4>Then, The Driver Arrives</h4>
    <div class="left">
      <p><strong>Taxi</strong></p>
      <p>I get in and tell the driver a location. The driver doesn't respond and peels out, cutting off another car in the process. (Best case scenario: they start driving safely. Unfortunately, this has not been my experience.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p><strong>Uber</strong></p>
      <p>I get a text saying my Uber has arrived. I get downstairs and the driver is waiting outside of the car. He/She greets me, opens the door and offers cold water, snacks and gum. Once inside, driver asks how my day is going and then requests an address to head to.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="question">
    <h4>Then, The Driver Arrives <sup>2</sup></h4>
    <div class="left">
      <p><strong>Taxi</strong></p>
      <p>I get in and tell driver a location. Driver says 'I dont know where that is'. There is an awkward silence while waiting for the driver to do his job: ask question to get a better idea of my destination. I end up loading Google Maps on my phone for turn-by-turn directions, for fear that we will sit in this awkward situation for the rest of my life.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p><strong>Uber</strong></p>
      <p>See above. After giving the driver an address, he/she says 'Sorry, I'm not familiar with the address. Do you mind if I put it in my GPS so I can make sure to get you to there on time?'</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="question">
    <h4>En Route</h4>
    <div class="left">
      <p><strong>Taxi</strong></p>
      <p>The commute continues while the driver is talking on the phone, driving like a maniac and cutting off other drivers, bicyclists, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p><strong>Uber</strong></p>
      <p>The driver is obeying traffic laws, not talking on the phone and is paying attention to the road. Some even maintain a nice conversation with you, if that's something you enjoy.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="question">
    <h4>Arrival</h4>
    <div class="left">
      <p><strong>Taxi</strong></p>
      <p>Seeing the cost of the ride on the meter, I pull out my debit card to start the payment process. 'Sorry, no cards.', another awkward silence since they <strong>must</strong> accept cards. ' Ok, fine, hold on.' The driver then rumages through his/her glove compartment before claiming that the credit card machine is broken. Show continues as he makes more of a fuss about accepting a debit card, and then a Square Card Reader appears. After transaction is complete, there is silence and I exit the vehicle. With just enough time to shut the door, the driver peels away again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p><strong>Uber</strong></p>
      <p>'Alright sir, here we are. Please allow me to get your door.' - Driver exits, opens the door for me, and says 'Thank you very much Manik, have a great day.' Note: He/she often will address me by name throughout the ride. Very simple action with a big impact. I exit the vehicle at my destination, in one piece, without being frustrated by my commute. I say thanks and goodbye, knowing that my fare &amp; the driver's tip is paid and I can review the entire trip later when my e-mail receipt arrives. <em>Effortless</em>.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

<p>This comparison is not an exaggeration or a biased view - this is based on using several cabs and several Ubers since last year between New York City, Chicago and San Francisco.</p>

<p>Another fun fact - <a href="https://uber.com/invite/x90cv" title="Sign Up For uber" itemprop="url">UberX in San Francisco</a> (referral link) is now cheaper than most cabs &amp; is better for the environment. So, there's that.</p>

<p>Comments are welcome. What</p>

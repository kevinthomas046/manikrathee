<p class="intro">President Barack Obama's re-election campaign was the most digitally advanced campaign in the history of modern politics. Some of the best developers, engineers and designers in the world came together to build some incredibly intuitive applications and websites that helped manage &amp; monitor GOTV efforts, helped educate voters and helped spread the word about the President's policies.

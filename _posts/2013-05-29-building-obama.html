<p>In April of this year, I had the pleasure to give the opening keynote at the 10th anniversary of the Thinking Creative Conference in New Jersey. Naturally, I was asked to speak about my experience on the Obama campaign in 2012. So, I put together a talk called <em>Building Obama</em> which went into detail on various projects I was a part of and what went into building the front-end of them. I also talked about our approach to optimise these products for the tens-of-millions of users that would come to <a href="http://www.barackobama.com" title="barackobama.com" itemprop="url">barackobama.com</a>.</p>

<p>Below is the video of my talk, which was recorded and edited by the Kean University video team, along with my slides via <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/manikrathee/building-obama" title="Building Obama on SpeakerDeck" itemprop="url">SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>
